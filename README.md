# PyBer (Ride Sharing Data Analysis)
Data Analysis and Visualization of Ride Sharing Data

## Resources
1) Anaconda version 2.1.1
2) Jupyter-Notebook version 6.4.5
3) ipykernal
4) Python version 3.7.7
5) Pandas
6) Matplotlib

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory analysis of Pyber Ride Sharing data to better understand the relationship between ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates. In this assignment we will also use data visualization tools and techniques to understand and determine the accessibility and affordability of Pyber in economically struggling communities.

By reviewing the summary we can see that there are several key findings including: 
- Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
- Urban cities have 4x more drivers than suburban cities.
- Suburban cities have 6x more drivers than rural with almost 4.5x the revenue.
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver. 
- The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides. 

## Summary

Based on the above analysis following are the 3 business recommendations for CEO at Pyber: 
1) Increase the amount of drivers in rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet rider demand. 
2) Since the average fare per ride and average fare per driver in rural markets is much higher than suburban and urban markets, which indicates that rural riders are taking longer trips. This can result in loss of business during peak business hours when drivers are making long distance drop offs.
3) Finally, increase the number of drivers in rurals with added incentives to the drivers for longer wait times.
